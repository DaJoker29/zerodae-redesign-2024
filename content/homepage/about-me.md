I'm **Dewitt Buckingham**, the brains (and caffeine-fueled code wizard) behind this operation. With a love for all things web-related and enough coding know-how to make your browser blush, I've been tinkering with websites since the days of dial-up (seriously).

But more than just a web geek, I'm a **passionate advocate for small businesses and freelancers** like yourself. I've seen firsthand the power of a killer websiteâ€”how it can elevate your brand, boost your business, and turn curious clickers into loyal customers.

Years and years of navigating the web cosmos has left me with a **network of collaborators** that stretches far and wide. These creative geniuses and digital daredevils are my secret weapon, bringing their A-game to every project.


So whether you're a solopreneur with big dreams or a small business ready to take on the digital world, I'm here to be your trusty sidekick. Let's embark on this digital adventure together, shall we?
